#machine-learning-ng
It contains solutions of coding assignments of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning on Coursera

##Introduction
There are six assignments in total (from week 2 to week 7). Each folder is one assignment.   
ex1 -- Linear regression;   
ex2 -- Logistic regression;   
ex3 -- Multiclass classification and neural network;  
ex4 -- Neural Networks Learning;  
ex5 -- Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance;  
ex6 -- Support Vector Machines;  

##Instalation
In each folder, you will use scripts "ex1" "ex2" "ex3" "ex4" "ex5" "ex6". You can open and run them directly. These scripts set up the dataset for the problems and make calls to functions of which I wrote some.
